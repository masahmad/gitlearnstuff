agile notes

follow agile/ scrum techniques in that we do iterative development

depending on project / size and complexity


scrum process framework -  development cycles  called sprints
xp framework - requires pair programming

Scrum is most often used to manage complex software and product development, using iterative and incremental practices. Scrum significantly increases productivity and reduces time to benefits relative to classic “waterfall” processes. Scrum processes enable organizations to adjust smoothly to rapidly-changing requirements, and produce a product that meets evolving business goals. An agile Scrum process benefits the organization by helping it to

    Increase the quality of the deliverables
    Cope better with change (and expect the changes)
    Provide better estimates while spending less time creating them
    Be more in control of the project schedule and state

sprint - can be  2 days to 30 days
split release backlog in to sprints

burndown chart -  get overview of progress and work remaning. monitor rate of productivity. calculate completion.

daily scrum
