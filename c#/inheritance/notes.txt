When a class is derived from another derived class it is called Multilevel Inheritance. In Multilevel Inheritance, there is one base class and the remaining two are derived classes. In Single Inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of a single super class. Hierarchical Inheritance is a method of inheritance where one or more derived classes is derived from common base class. The following programs illustrate Multilevel Inheritance, Single Inheritance, Hierarchical Inheritance and displays the cost of a rectangle plot using Inheritance.
